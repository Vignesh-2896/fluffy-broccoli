#  Anime Message Board application with Passport JS Authentication. 

Small application where users can signup, login and post their thoughts on the various manga and anime.
The authentication for this was built using the Local Strategy provided by (Passport JS)[https://www.passportjs.org/].
Any action will send messages to the main screen on redirection which was done using (Flash Messages)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-flash].

Admin user has the ability to see a Delete option under all posts and therefore can delete posts if required.
